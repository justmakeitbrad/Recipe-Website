    <h2>Description</h2>
    My girlfriend has a dairy allergy which makes ordering pizza hard and expensive.
        With this recipe, we acn eat a delicious pizza whenever we want.
        This recipe saves us a lot of money since we will be making our own crust and sauce
        with a few simple ingrdients from the grocery store and enough left over to make more 
        in the future.
