    <h2>Description</h2>
        Cookie dough sitting in the fridge is hard to resist. Especially when it is safe to eat!
        Eggs and flour used to bake cookies need to be treated. We will be taking the proper steps 
        to lower any chances of bacteria in our cookie dough.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk of choice</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        Start by heat treating your flour in either the microwave or oven.
        <p></p>
        To heat treat flour in the microwave, place the flour in a large (soup) bowl. 
        Heat it in 30-second intervals for about 2 minutes. 
        Mix with a spoon in-between intervals. 
        <p></p>
        To heat treat flour in the oven, start your oven at 300 F.
        Spread the flour evenly on a baking mat or paper. Bake in 2-minute intervals.
        Mix with a spoon in-between intervals, without scraping the bottom. 
        If some flour is stuck to the bottom, just leave it there, donâ€™t use that.
